## Description

_This website takes user inputs for name, age, time since age, and time until age. Once submitted, the site generates the user's age in earth years, murcury years, venus years, and mars years. If the user submitted an input for time since age, the form will show how many years have passed on each planet since a past birthday. For example, if a user is 35 and we calculate time since 10th birthday, we would find the following results: "25 Earth years have passed. 104.2 Mercury years have passed. 40.3 Venus years have passed. 13.3 Mars years have passed. 2.1 Jupiter years have passed." If the user submitted an input for time until agem the form will show how many years will pass on each planet until a future birthday. For example, if the user is 35 and we want to calculate the time until their 40th birthday, the results will be: "5 Earth years have yet to pass. 20.8 Mercury years have yet to pass. 8.1 Venus years have yet to pass. 2.7 Mars years have yet to pass. 0.4 Jupiter years have yet to pass."_
